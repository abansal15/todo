# Todo List Application with React

This is a simple Todo List application built with ReactJS. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and filter tasks based on their completion status.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
git clone  https://github.com/abansal15/todo.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd todo
 
3. Install dependencies: npm i

4. Run the project: npm start

The application will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Design Decisions

- **Styling**: Applied basic styling using inline styles directly within JSX elements to keep the code concise and self-contained.
- **State Management**: Utilized React's useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and persisting data in local storage.
- **Component Structure**: Organized components into separate files for better modularity and maintainability.
- **Filtering**: Implemented filtering options to allow users to view all tasks, completed tasks, or incomplete tasks.
- **Persistence**: Saved the task list to local storage to ensure data persistence between page reloads.
